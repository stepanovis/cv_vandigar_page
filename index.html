                        <h5><b> Head of product, Marketplace platform / qlean.ru </b></h5>
                        <p>When I joined the company, the process of transitioning from a monolith on ruby to a platform of services on node.js was underway. A seamless transition was required, given that two mobile apps were tied to the monolith.</p>
                        <p>Management expected the work was almost done. However, after diving into the project, it became clear that a new approach to application integration with the platform needed to be designed. During my time at the company:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed an ACL (anti-corruption layer) for a soft launch of the new platform. Drafted a work plan that the team followed up until my departure from the company.</li>
                            <li>Designed the integration of the mobile application for clients, the operational platform, and the logistics system for the launch of a new product for goods delivery.</li>
                            <li>Took over a project initiated by another manager on developing a front-office system for customer support. The project deadlines were unclear. Clarified the requirements with the client and communicated them to the team. Completed the development of the MVP version by the time I left the company.</li>
                            <li>Merged the node.js teams into one to boost the development service's performance since there were 4 teams with 2 members each. As a result, development began to perform at a predictable pace.</li>
                            <li>Set up scrum processes in the development team: planning, daily stand-ups, demos, retrospectives.</li>
                            <li>Established performance indicators for the development team: bug tracking in terms of quantity and prioritization, tracking of lead time, cycle time, and task analysis in specific statuses to identify bottlenecks. One such bottleneck was testing, as there was only one tester. Therefore, I partially shifted testing responsibilities onto the backend developers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5><b>System Analyst | Architect | Head of architecture / skyeng.ru</b></h5>
                        <p>In the company, I transitioned from being a system analyst on the IT projects to the head of IT architecture department. During this time:</p>

                        <p><b class="b-studylist">CRM System Transition</b></p>
                        <p>I undertook a project to transition from an inhouse CRM system based on a state machine, which served as the business core and data source for all other systems, to a process-oriented CRM system consisting of domain components and services. As an analyst, I led a small team of 3 analysts, wrote user stories, depicted ERD, gathered requirements from the client, and filtered incoming requests for new feature to meet the deadlines. I resolved all stages from requirement collection to system deployment.</p>
                        <p>One and a half years of work resulted in more than 200 user stories. With team was developed 5 major modules: sales, support, teacher search, awake service, and core of system. We provided executable BPMS diagrams in Camunda and successfully launched the system.</p>

                        <p><b class="b-studylist">Transition to Architecture Team</b></p>
                        <p>After the CRM project was implemented, I joined the architecture team. I designed business solutions at the IT and business levels of architecture, and validated the economic and business values of projects. Over a year, I worked on three major projects where I described the business challenges, potential business and technical solutions and estimate implementation costs. Upon the project defenses, I successfully argued for the need to abandon the realization because none of the projects passed an economic justification. One project was simplified to a simple managerial procedure instead of an expensive IT solution.</p>
                        <p>Company has savings of around ~1m$ by not initiating these projects.</p>

                        <p><b class="b-studylist">As Head of Architecture</b></p>
                        <p>In a role as the head of architecture, I established a repository for ADR and created a universal dashboard displaying Coupling/Cohesion metrics. Based on this, architects identified problematic services. I designed another dashboard using Maurice H. Halstead metrics that show which services need an attention in first priority. I made a IT landscape map with key parameters of services which help to understand the borders of responsibility of the services and they purpose. Suggested a architecture of IT landscape where business and IT services had shared boundaries, aiming to form as many autonomous teams as possible. All of these solutions initiated a consensus process among teams, uncovering many projects with ambiguous agreements. During my tenure, there were about 20 development teams in the company, facing challenges because teams frequently blocked each other. Sadly, the enterprise architecture transformation project's deployment was halted due to a crisis in the company, because of an objective to reduce costs and personnel.</p>
                        <p>I introduced a framework to measure architecture quality, providing an entry point for every developer to address architectural issues. Two major projects were prepared for corporate architecture transformation, but unfortunately, they were not initiated.</p>

                        <p>Upon joining the company as an analyst, I enlightened the leadership on the role of a product manager and successfully persuaded them to expand its responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The company's product was a CRM system that required modifications for each deployment. The company's aim was to sell the system as an off-the-shelf solution. To achieve this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sales Management Interface Overhaul: Redesigned the user interfaces for the sales managers.</li>
                            <li>Long-term Deals Interface Revamp: Refurbished the interface to manage long-term deals.</li>
                            <li>Short-term Deals Interface Overhaul: Redesigned the user interface for managing short-term deals.</li>
                            <li>Project Management Module Design: Conceived and designed a basic project management module.</li>
                            <li>Omnichannel Chat Implementation: Designed and launched an omnichannel chat feature for interacting with clients.</li>
                            <li>Educational Video Series: Produced a series of video presentations for clients, illustrating the system's operations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These innovations resulted in the company securing a distributor for the off-the-shelf solution in Kazakhstan, boosting system sales without deployment services by 27%.</p>
